# Template for Encrypted Single Page Website

This template repository makes it easy to create a password protected page that is hosted on Github pages.
This can be useful for information or events that should not be available to everyone, e.g. for your birthday, wedding or a corporate event.

To check the [demo](https://a-nau.github.io/password-protected-website-template) use the password `test`.

## Usage

- [Create a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) by clicking the `use this template` button
- Select a repository name (your URL will be `{GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME}.github.io/{REPOSITORY-NAME}`)
- Choose the repository to be **private**, if you don't want people to be able to access the contents without the password
- [Create a Github secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `DECRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` and set the `value` to your desired password (note that the CI pipeline will fail on the first attempt due to the missing password)
- [Set the publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) to the `main` branch in order to activate hosting with Github Pages

To customize the website:

- You can customize the login page

  - adjust the [encrypt_with_assets.yml](.github/workflows/encrypt_with_assets.yml), i.e. the "Encrypt index" step to set the title, instructions and button name

    ```yaml
    - name: Encrypt index
      run: >
        staticrypt index.html -p ${{ secrets.DECRYPTION_PASSPHRASE }} --short
        --template "password_template.html"
        --template-title "Login"
        --template-instructions "This is a test website, use the password 'test' to enter."
        --template-button "Open Page"
        --template-color-primary "#113e9f"
        --template-color-secondary "#e4e4e4"
    ```

  - For details and to change the full layout, see [StatiCrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt)

- Edit the `main.html` which will be shown to visitors after encryption (the encrypted version, that is hosted is `index.html`)
  - Assets can be used as usual and will not be encrypted

### Encrypted Assets

By default encryption of assets is enables, since the workflow [`encrypt_with_assets.yml`](.github/workflows/encrypt_with_assets.yml) is active.
Note, this only replaces all directly linked images, CSS and JavaScript file in the HTML document with an in-place base64 representation.
Thus, your relative links in files will probably not work anymore, since their location changed.

If you do not want to encrypt assets remove the asset folder from the `exclude`s of the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) and cut the following lines from [`encrypt_with_assets.yml`](.github/workflows/encrypt_with_assets.yml) and paste them into [`encrypt_without_assets.yml`](.github/workflows/encrypt_without_assets.yml)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

### Local Usage

If you don't want to have any of your data (even) in a private repository you can also convert it locally and only upload the `index.html` afterwards.
To do this, follow these steps:

- Build the image
  ```
  docker build -t ppw .
  ```
- Run the encryption
  ```
  docker run -it --rm --name ppw -e PASSWORD=test --mount type=bind,source=${PWD},target=/code ppw
  ```
- Ignore changes to `main.html`
  ```
  git update-index --skip-worktree main.html
  ```
  Optionally the same is needed for your assets.
